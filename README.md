# poker

nothing interesting here
this is basically:

1) practice using classes
2) practice organizing a larger project
3) something to get me learning more about poker

i planned to make a poker "game" but I realized the most interesting thing to me is the probability estimation
(using monte carlo) so that's really the focus.

however, it's fairly slow (I know there are some parts of the code that could easily be optimized).
i will likely optimize those and rewrite them in C++
