# poker

Nothing fancy here. I basically treated this as a project to help me do a few things.

1) get to know the game of poker a little better
2) get more used to organizing a few files/classes/etc in a better way (still obviously not perfect)

While I was working on it, I realized I cared a lot more about the probability aspect (estimated thru Monte Carlo simulation) than the game creation aspect,
so that's where I focused the bulk of my mental energy.

Additionally the code is pretty slow and needs optimization (I might optimize then rewrite in C++ to make it even faster...)
